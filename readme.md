# **SafeDrive: Fog Detection and Accident Prevention**

This project enhances road safety in foggy conditions using a sensor array with YOLO v8 object detection. It provides real-time alerts to drivers and automates responses to prevent accidents.

## Methodology

- **Sensor Array**: Ultrasonic distance sensor, blink sensor, and buzzer for real-time data.

- **System Operation**: Microcontroller processes sensor data, triggers alerts, and uses YOLO v8 for object detection.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

- **Challenges**: Limited effectiveness in extreme fog, dependency on sensor accuracy, range limitations, interference, false positives, maintenance requirements, and cost constraints.
- **Future Improvements**: Multi-spectral cameras, Li-DAR technology, physical fog sensors, accelerometers for accident detection, and cellular modules for distress messaging.

## Conclusion

Sensor kits advance road safety despite challenges. Ongoing research and tech improvements promise to revolutionize road safety, saving lives in adverse conditions.
